# Cameron Southern - Portfolio
Hello! My name is Cameron Southern. I am a current student at Ivy Tech and a part-time employee at my local pizza restaurant, Pizza Pantry. I am a member of Ivy Tech's accelerated associates degree program and I will be graduating in May after only 11 months of classes. It's been hard work keeping up with the 3, 4, or 5 classes that I've had every 8 weeks and also my job. On top of my job and classes, I am also a student leader of the accelerated program and an officer of admissions for my college's honors society, Phi Theta Kappa. After I graduate in May, I will be transferring to Indiana University Bloomington to pursue a bachelors in game development and I will most likely also pursue a bachelors in cyber security (time and schedule permitting). I'm hoping to find a local job or a remote position for either game development or cyber security after graduating IU.
